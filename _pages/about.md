I am a senior undergraduate in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) and [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). I also visited [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and did research with [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at the summer of 2019. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).

My research interests lie in deep learning methods on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graph. My research goal is to bridge machine learning models and symbolic human knowledge.
