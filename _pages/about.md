I am a final-year PhD student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) and also work closely with [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). Previously, I received my B.E. in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from Tsinghua University in 2020. I also visited [BLENDER Lab@UIUC](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) in 2024 and 2019, where I fortunately worked with [Prof. Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) and [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/), respectively. My CV is availiable [here](/cv/).

<i>I'm on the job market now. Please feel free to reach out if you think I could be a good fit.</i>

My research interest lies in natural language processing, machine learning, and knowledge engineering. The research directions I am fascinated in and working on include:

1. **Understanding Lanaguge Models** (Mechanistic Interpretability, etc.)
  - How to understand the inner workings of language models and how can the findings fundamentally help improve and steer language models.
  - Projects: [Skill Neuron](/files/EMNLP22-SkillNeuron/SkillNeuron.pdf), [Intrinsic Task Subspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07867), [Conceptual Knowledge Probing](/files/EMNLP22-COPEN/COPEN.pdf) 
2. **Complicated Information Seeking** (Knowledge Acquisition, etc.)
  - How to enable language models seek and understand complicated knowledge like events and causalities.
  - Datasets: [MAVEN](/files/EMNLP20-MAVEN/MAVEN.pdf), [MAVEN-ERE](/files/EMNLP22-MAVEN-ERE/MAVEN-ERE.pdf), [MAVEN-Arg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09105)
  - Toolkit: [OmniEvent](https://github.com/THU-KEG/OmniEvent), [Evaluation Pitfalls](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.586.pdf)
