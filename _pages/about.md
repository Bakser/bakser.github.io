I am a 1st-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am supervised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/). I also visited [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and did research with [Prof. Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at the summer of 2019. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).

My research interests lie in deep learning methods on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graph. My research goal is to bridge machine learning models and symbolic human knowledge.

## News
* [Aug. 2020] Got two papers accepted at EMNLP 2020. See you online:)
* [Sep. 2019] Released a [pre-trained language model reading list](https://github.com/thunlp/PLMpapers) with [Zhengyan Zhang](https://github.com/zzy14). Enjoy it!
* [Aug. 2019] Got one paper accepted at EMNLP 2019. See you at Hong Kong.
